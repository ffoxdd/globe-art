- Inject the random number stuff into area_calculator and centroid_calculator to avoid reinitializing
- Make type aliases for the spherical types in area_calculator_test, test_spherical_polygon, etc.
- Combine AreaCalculator and CentroidCalculator
- Stop using the underscore prefix convention for private data members
- Use the term "density" instead of "noise" where appropriate
- Make a directed spherical arc type
    - Compose a spherical arc and a direction
    - Need PointsCollection::directed_dual_cell_arcs
    - For that we need directed triangulation::dual_on_sphere

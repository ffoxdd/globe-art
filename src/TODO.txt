- Inject the random number stuff into area_calculator and centroid_calculator to avoid reinitializing
- Make type aliases for the spherical types in area_calculator_test, test_spherical_polygon, etc.
- Combine AreaCalculator and CentroidCalculator
- Stop using the underscore prefix convention for private data members
- Use the term "density" instead of "noise" where appropriate
